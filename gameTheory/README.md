# gameTheory
Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interactions among rational agents.[1] It has applications in many fields of social science, used extensively in economics as well as in logic, systems science and computer science.

Traditional game theory addressed two-person zero-sum games, in which a participant's gains or losses are exactly balanced by the losses and gains of the other participant. In the 21st century, game theory applies to a wider range of behavioral relations, and it is now an umbrella term for the science of logical decision making in humans, animals, as well as computers.
